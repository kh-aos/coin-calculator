Hello all, 

I know the cryptocurrency community is growing exponentially day by day. So, I present you a simple tool to show you the expected worth of your cryptos - if you invest now or if you had invested.
It is not a scam, it does not save any info or whatsoever.

Please find the same tool on:

Thanks https://api.coingecko.com/ for these awesome apis!
